#### Two Article Recommendations:

I stumbled upon these NPR articles recently that I thought were both interesting and relevent to our class. They relate to topics of diversity and privilege in education and are worth a read.

1. [Why Are Colleges Really Going Test-Optional?][Link 1]

#### Book Recommendation:
#####Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates

I am going to recommend a book that I have yet to read, but is next in my queue. I saw an interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates on the Daily Show this summer and was instantly intrigued with his work. Coates discusses racial matters in a very open, direct, and personal way, representing an important voice in our modern political conversations. His book is highly regarded by many and has been recommended to me so many times that I am now passing along that recommendation.
